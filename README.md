# Flask Lessons: Flask Personal Log

Flask is a popular web framework for Python that allows developers
to quickly build web applications and APIs. One of the key features
of Flask is its simplicity and flexibility, making it an excellent
choice for small to medium-sized projects.

To get started with Flask, it's recommended to familiarize yourself
with some basic code examples. Here's a simple Flask application that
defines a route and returns a basic "Hello, World!" message:

```
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

In this example, we're creating a new Flask application using the Flask
constructor. We're also defining a route using the `@app.route` decorator,
which maps the root URL `/` to the `hello_world()` function. Finally,
we're starting the application using the `app.run()` method.

This simple Flask application can be run by saving the code to a file
called `app.py` and running it using the command `python3 app.py` in the
terminal. When you visit `http://localhost:5000` in your browser, you
should see the message `Hello, World!` displayed on the page.

From here, you can start exploring more advanced features of Flask,
such as templates, forms, and database integration. But this simple example
should give you a good starting point for getting comfortable with Flask.
